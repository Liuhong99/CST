    """
    Semantic consistency loss is introduced by
    `CyCADA: Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Domain Adaptation (ICML 2018) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03213>`_

    This helps to prevent label flipping during image translation.

    Args:
        ignore_index (tuple, optional): Specifies target values that are ignored
            and do not contribute to the input gradient. When :attr:`size_average` is
            ``True``, the loss is averaged over non-ignored targets. Default: ().
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C)` where `C = number of classes`, or
          :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: :math:`(N)` where each value is :math:`0 \leq \text{targets}[i] \leq C-1`, or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of
          K-dimensional loss.
        - Output: scalar.
          If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then the same size as the target:
          :math:`(N)`, or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case
          of K-dimensional loss.

    Examples::

        >>> loss = SemanticConsistency()
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.empty(3, dtype=torch.long).random_(5)
        >>> output = loss(input, target)
        >>> output.backward()
